## History

Our chapter was officially accepted as a local (ISC)² Chapter for the Kansas region in early 2018.
What does that mean? Access to more national organization resources for everyone interested in cyber security! 

## Our Mission



## Your Participation
You do **not** have to be a credentialed member of (ISC)² to be involved. Come join our meetings, free of charge with no obligation. Our chapter is a place to network, learn, share whether currently working in the field or is interested in learning more.

If you *are* a credentialed (ISC)² member, participating in our meetings provides valuable CPE credits.
