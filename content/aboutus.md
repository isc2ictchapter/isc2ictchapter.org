## History

Our chapter was officially accepted as a local (ISC)² Chapter for the Kansas region in early 2018.
What does that mean? Access to more national organization resources for everyone interested in cyber security! 

## Our Mission
To become a trusted resource for security education and awareness in the South Central Kansas area. We hope to facilitate communication between local businesses and security professionals so each can better understand and represent the other's needs. We want to establish a preferred group for security professionals, and those interested in information security, to network and exchange ideas and experiences, and hopefully grow the capabilities of security professionalism.


## Your Participation
You do **not** have to be a credentialed member of (ISC)² to be involved. Come join our meetings, free of charge with no obligation. Our chapter is a place to network, learn, share whether currently working in the field or is interested in learning more.

If you *are* a credentialed (ISC)² member, participating in our meetings provides valuable CPE credits.
