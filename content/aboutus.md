If you haven't heard, we are now certified as an official (ISC)² Chapter! 

What does that mean? Access to more national organization resources for everyone interested in cyber security! 

Remember, you do not have to be a credentialed member of (ISC)² to be involved. 

The Wichita chapter is a place to network, learn, share whether currently working in the field or is interested in learning more.
