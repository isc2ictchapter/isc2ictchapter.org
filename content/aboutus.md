## History
Our chapter was officially accepted as a local (ISC)² Chapter for the Kansas region in December 2017!
What does that mean? Access to more national organization resources for everyone interested in cyber security! 

## Our Vision & Mission
To become a trusted resource for security education and awareness in the South Central Kansas area. We hope to facilitate communication between local businesses and security professionals so each can better understand and represent the other's needs. We want to establish a preferred group for security professionals, and those interested in information security, to network and exchange ideas, knowledge and experiences, and hopefully grow the capabilities of security professionalism.
