# Join Us

## Monthly Chapter Meetings

You do **NOT** have to be a credentialed member of (ISC)² to be involved. Come join our meetings, free of charge with no obligation. Our chapter is a place to network, learn, and share whether you're currently working in the field or simply interested in learning more. We want to encourage active participation.

If you *are* a credentialed (ISC)² member, participating in our meetings provides valuable CPE credits. We'll even submit them for you if you sign-in via our sign-in form (distrubted during the meeting).

## Study Groups

Our Wichita Chapter may have dues for certain special activities such as Study Groups. We implemented these dues for two purposes:

1. This helps to ensure that participants are committed to attending the meetings so our volunteer leaders efforts aren't being wasted.
2. To provide funding to support the local chapter and ensure it's ongoing sustainability.

If these dues are a problem, reach out to a chapter officer to inquire about gratis participation.
