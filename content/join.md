## Join Us
You do **not** have to be a credentialed member of (ISC)² to be involved. Come join our meetings, free of charge with no obligation. Our chapter is a place to network, learn, share whether currently working in the field or is interested in learning more. We want to encourage active participation.

If you *are* a credentialed (ISC)² member, participating in our meetings provides valuable CPE credits.

Our Wichita Chapter does have dues for certain special activities such as Study Groups. We implemented these dues for two purposes:
    1. To ensure that participants have some "skin in the game" to join.
    2. To provide funding to support the local chapter and ensure it's ongoing sustainability.
If these dues are a problem, reach out to a chapter officer to inquire about gratis participation.
