## Join Us
You do **NOT** have to be a credentialed member of (ISC)² to be involved. Come join our meetings, free of charge with no obligation. Our chapter is a place to network, learn, share whether currently working in the field or is interested in learning more. We want to encourage active participation.

If you *are* a credentialed (ISC)² member, participating in our meetings provides valuable CPE credits. We'll even submit them for you if you sign-in via our sign-in form (distrubted during the meeting).

Our Wichita Chapter does have dues for certain special activities such as Study Groups. We implemented these dues for two purposes:
<ol>
    <li>To ensure that participants have some "skin in the game" to join.</li>
    <li>To provide funding to support the local chapter and ensure it's ongoing sustainability.</li>
</ol>
If these dues are a problem, reach out to a chapter officer to inquire about gratis participation.
